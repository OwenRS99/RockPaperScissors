Rock Paper Scissors

In this project i demostrated basic knowledge of functions, loops, if/else statements and the math libary.
This is a basic console application for Rock Paper Scissors, the user chooses either Rock, Paper or Scissors and the computer will randomly pick a number between 0, 1, 2. 

I have used numerous operators to complete this project, most notebly the && (and) also the || (or) operator, Because this game is comparing the user input to the computers input these operators were neccisary.
